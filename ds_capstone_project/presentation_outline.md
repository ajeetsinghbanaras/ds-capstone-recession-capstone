# Presentation Outline – Economic Indicators & Recession Prediction

You can copy this structure into PowerPoint or Google Slides and export as PDF.

1. Title Slide
   - Project title: Economic Indicators & Recession Prediction
   - Your name
   - Course / Capstone info

2. Executive Summary
   - Short overview of dataset (countries, years, indicators)
   - Mention EDA, SQL, Folium, Dash, and classification model
   - 2–3 key insights or findings

3. Introduction
   - Why study recessions and economic indicators?
   - What questions are you trying to answer?
   - Brief description of synthetic dataset

4. Data Collection & Wrangling
   - Source: Synthetic dataset generated for this capstone
   - Columns used (GDP, inflation, unemployment, etc.)
   - Cleaning steps: types, missing values, feature engineering (GDP growth)

5. EDA & Interactive Visual Analytics – Methodology
   - Tools: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly, Folium
   - Types of charts: histograms, boxplots, time-series, heatmaps
   - How interactive tools (Folium + Dash) help exploration

6. EDA Visualisation – Results (2–3 slides)
   - Show GDP distributions and trends
   - Show inflation/unemployment differences by country
   - Show correlation heatmap and interpret key relationships

7. SQL EDA – Methodology & Results (2–3 slides)
   - Explain SQLite table and why SQL is useful
   - Show queries: top GDP, average inflation, worst unemployment, recession rate
   - Add 1–2 short bullet insights per query

8. Folium Map – Results
   - Screenshot of folium_economic_map.html
   - Explain markers and what each popup shows (GDP + inflation)
   - Mention how geography adds context

9. Plotly Dash Dashboard – Results
   - Screenshot of running dashboard with GDP + inflation trends
   - Explain dropdown country selection
   - Show how user can compare countries interactively

10. Predictive Analysis – Methodology
   - Explain features: GDP, growth, inflation, unemployment, etc.
   - Model: RandomForest classifier
   - Train/test split and evaluation metrics

11. Predictive Analysis – Results
   - Show classification report (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
   - Show confusion matrix and what it means
   - Short bullet: when model predicts recession vs non-recession

12. Conclusion
   - Summarise main insights from EDA, SQL, and model
   - Mention limitations (synthetic data, simple model)
   - Suggest future improvements with real data

13. Creativity & Innovative Insights
   - Any extra graphs or comparisons you added
   - Any patterns you discovered yourself
